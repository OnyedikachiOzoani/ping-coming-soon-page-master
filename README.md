## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Submit their email address using an `input` field
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_
